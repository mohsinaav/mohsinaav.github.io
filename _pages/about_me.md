My name is Mohsina.A.V. üôÇ

I live in **Redmond**, Washington, USA; home of Microsoft, Amazon, Nintendo. 

Redmond is a beautiful and peaceful place to settle down. Seattle is close and provide great career opportunities. I am currently waiting for my Employment authorization (EAD), which is required for immigrants to work in the USA. Due to Covid, processing time is more than the usual.

Meanwhile, I am working on some personal projects, using Python, ML, etc. Currently, I am learning Flask micro framework. I will be posting working details of such projects. I am planning to post some general articles on how to survive in the USA and formalities related to passports, visas and so on. This blog will be a small journal for me.

Some other details are:

**Birth place**: Kozhikode, Kerala, India

**Schooling**: Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, India

**Bachelors**: Electronics and Communication Engineering, CET, Kerala, India

**Master**: Automation and Control Systems, Electrical Engineering, NUS, Singapore

Here is my [resume](https://github.com/mohsinaav/mohsinaav.github.io/edit/master/assets/resume.pdf).

Hope to keep this initiative going steadily !!! Stay tune. üëç
