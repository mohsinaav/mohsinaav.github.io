In this article, I would like to discuss the process involved in renewing your Indian passport for outside the country. 
Step-by-step process are described in detail below:

1. Fill the application form:
   * Go to website https://embassy.passportindia.gov.in/, select the country from where you are applying. It will redirect you to the login page. Either register or 
   login here. 
   * After finishing the initial part of registering or logging in, you will be on the applicant home page. Todo: add a picture here.
   * Select the first option, Apply for Ordinary Passport. 
  Provide all the required details and submit it once completed. Sample application form is available here. 
  Print the application. You will need to sign it, on two places. Application Reference Number mentioned in the form is required in later stages.
		
2. Payment step: 
   * Next step is to create a postal label after paying the fee. Go to https://services.vfsglobal.com/usa/en/ind/postal-interim, select the option as per your 
  requirement. Select the option Passport and fill the details. It will redirect you to VFS.GLOBAL login or register page. After logging in, make the payment.
  Once the payment is done, you can create the courier label.
		
3. Physical application:
   * With the above step, online process is complete. Next we need to send the application booklet via mail. Document checklist is available here. 
  Print it out. Gather all the documents, get it signed and notarized. Send the application package.
