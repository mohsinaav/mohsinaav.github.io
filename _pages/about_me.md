My name is Mohsina.A.V.

I was born in Kozhikode, Kerala, a south Indian state also known as ' God's own country '. I did my schooling at Bhilai, a major industrial city in India and an educational hub in central India. After that, I completed my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from College of Engineering, Trivandrum, Kerala. Later, I joined Mindtree Ltd, Bengaluru as Software Engineer and was trained in Microsoft technologies including Asp.net, SSIS, SQL. I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer, in a span of 2 years. From there, I took a sabbatical leave and joined National Univerity of Singapore for pursuing Masters in Automation and Control Systems Engineering. It was an year long course.

Currently, I live in Redmond town, Washington, USA, home of Microsoft, Amazon, Nintendo. Redmond is a beautiful and peaceful place to settle down. Seattle is close to us and provide great career opportunities. I am currently waiting for my Employment authorization (EAD), which is required for immigrants to work in the USA. Due to Covid, processing time is more than the usual.

Meanwhile, I am working on some personal projects, using Python, ML, etc. Currently, I am learning Flask micro framework. I will be posting working details of such projects. I am planning to post some general articles on how to survive in the USA and formalities related to passports, visas and so on. This blog will be a small journal for me.

Hope to keep it going steadily. !!!

I will be adding details about my projects here. Stay tune.
